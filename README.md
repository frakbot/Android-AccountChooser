# Android-AccountChooser

---

**Account Chooser** for Android, backported from JellyBean.

`Android-AccountChooser` is a library that enables you to use the same method as `AccountManager#newChooseAccountIntent` (see the [official documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html)) introduced in API 14, from API Level 8 forward.

## Authors

## How to use

First, you have to include the given project as a library reference in your application project.

Then, include the following Activities in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
	<activity android:name="net.frakbot.accounts.chooser.ChooseTypeAndAccountActivity" />
	<activity android:name="net.frakbot.accounts.chooser.ChooseAccountActivity" />
	<activity android:name="net.frakbot.accounts.chooser.ChooseAccountTypeActivity" />
```

In the end call, instead of `AccountManager#newChooseAccountIntent`:

```java
AccountChooser.newChooseAccountIntent(
	selectedAccount, allowableAccounts, allowableAccountTypes,
	alwaysPromptForAccount, descriptionOverrideText, addAccountAuthTokenType,
	addAccountRequiredFeatures, addAccountOptions, context);
```

`AccountChooser` will then automatically detect the `Build.VERSION` number and use the most appropriate implementation, choosing from:

- the standard device implementation, if `Build.VERSION >= 14`
- the backported implementation from the API Level 17

See the [official documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html) for more help, as the behaviour is just the same.
